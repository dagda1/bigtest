# [Type-check test bundle](https://github.com/thefrontside/bigtest/issues/280)

## Assumptions
- The main requirement is to type check the bundle. Babel does not do typechecking.  

- Charles also mentioned this
> We still need a way to surface errors and state in a generic fashion since we'll most probably be adding checks that aren't just type checking (making sure there is a default export for example that is a `TestImplementation` object) is one that comes to mind.
  - can we flesh this out into actual requirements like
    - ensure there is a default export that is the TestImplementation object

## Questions
- Are we reporting errors only or do we want of fail the build or is this configurable.
  - Is a configurable `transpileOnly` option a good idea.  We could display type errors as warnings or fail

- The [validator](https://github.com/thefrontside/bigtest/blob/validator/packages/server/src/validator.ts) was spiked.  My only reservation with this nice extensible idea that creating your own typescript `createProgram` is actually a lot of work and there are a lot of edge cases and we could maybe piggyback on the back of something else.  Edge cases such as typescript project references and transpilers are things we want to avoid unless I am missing something.

- Could we possibly use [this](https://github.com/wessberg/rollup-plugin-ts) which has the following qualities:
  - You can use a [Browserslist](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist) for the `target` compiler option and not an ECMAScript version.
  - Babel can be used as the transpiler, rather than Typescript, such that Typescript handles diagnostics, declarations, and stripping away types, and Babel is used for syntax transformation.
  - It has a [diagnostics hook](https://github.com/wessberg/rollup-plugin-ts#the-diagnostics-hook)
- What have I missed
