# [Type-check test bundle](https://github.com/thefrontside/bigtest/issues/280)

## Assumptions
- The main requirement is to report type errors only as babel transpiles only
- we would be doing this in a separate process thread to the build to let the tests run fasters
- Charles also mentioned this
> We still need a way to surface errors and state in a generic fashion since we'll most probably be adding checks that aren't just type checking (making sure there is a default export for example that is a `TestImplementation` object) is one that comes to mind.
  - can we flesh this out into actual requirements like
    - ensure there is a default export that is the TestImplementation object

## Questions
- The [validator](https://github.com/thefrontside/bigtest/blob/validator/packages/server/src/validator.ts) was spiked.  My only reservation with this nice extensible idea that creating your own typescript `createProgram` is actually a lot of work and there are a lot of edge cases and we could maybe piggyback on the back of something else.
