# [Type-check test bundle](https://github.com/thefrontside/bigtest/issues/280)

## Assumptions
- The main requirement is to report type errors only as babel transpiles only
- Charles also mentioned this
> We still need a way to surface errors and state in a generic fashion since we'll most probably be adding checks that aren't just type checking (making sure there is a default export for example that is a `TestImplementation` object) is one that comes to mind.
  - can we flesh this out into actual requirements like
    - ensure there is a default export that is the TestImplementation object

## Questions
- How are we reporting errors and are these errors as warnings or can they fail the build
  - Is a configurable `transpileOnly` option a good idea.  We could display type errors as warnings or fail
- The [validator](https://github.com/thefrontside/bigtest/blob/validator/packages/server/src/validator.ts) was spiked.  My only reservation with this nice extensible idea that creating your own typescript `createProgram` is actually a lot of work and there are a lot of edge cases and we could maybe piggyback on the back of something else.
- Could we possibly use [this](https://github.com/wessberg/rollup-plugin-ts) which has the following qualities:
  - You can use a [Browserslist](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist) for the `target` compiler option and not an ECMAScript version.
  - Babel can be used as the transpiler, rather than Typescript, such that Typescript handles diagnostics, declarations, and stripping away types, and Babel is used for syntax transformation.
  - It has a [diagnostics hook](https://github.com/wessberg/rollup-plugin-ts#the-diagnostics-hook)
